# AI based data fusion model for cancer subtype diagnosis
## Background
The code contained in this repository was assembled and created for the Bachelor Thesis of Floor Laagland. The thesis was on cancer subtype diagnosis using AI based data fusion model for multi-omics data integration. Portion of the code are borrowed from previous work. The implementation of MDICC was used, with slight alterations, according to Yang et al. [1], see `demo.R`, `NetworkFusion.R`, `label.py`, `score.py` and `LocalAffinityMatrix.py`. The implementation of Dominant Set clustering was used, with slight alterations, according to Vascon et al. [2], see `demo_mdicc.m`.
